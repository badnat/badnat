Hello! My name is Nathaniel and I am a Astrophysics student at UNC Chapel Hill.
I love programming and electronics.
This git hub is both for my programming assginments at UNC and for Personal Projects.
I'm currently working on my LED array project. Hopefully adding a heat diffusion visualizer soon.
After that I'll be working on real time sound visualization.
